7.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    1. Implement automated data cleaning algorithms to handle common data quality issues such as missing values, 
    outliers, and inconsistencies.
    2. Provide options for users to customize data cleaning steps based on their specific requirements and preferences.
    3. Offer data preprocessing capabilities such as feature scaling, normalization, and encoding for machine learning tasks.

8.More Visualizations.
    1. Include more advanced visualization techniques such as heatmaps, pair plots, and box plots to explore relationships and 
    patterns in the data.
    2. Allow users to customize and interact with visualizations, such as filtering data subsets or adjusting plot 
    parameters dynamically.
    3. Provide interactive dashboards for users to create and save their own customized visualizations for future reference.
